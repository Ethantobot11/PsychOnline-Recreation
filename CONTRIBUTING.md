# When submitting a PR, remember to:
* **Test your code** if it works properly without any issues if the PR has breaking changes
* **COMMENT complicated** or harder to read **code** ex. what that line does in this algorithm?
* **AVOID formatting existing code** (it's harder for me to review your changes!)
* **WRITE THE CODE ALL BY YOURSELF**, don't steal code from others without any credit
* **NOT include irrevelant changes to the purpose of the PR** 
* **NOT USE AI**, you're forbidden to use any of AI features, if you can't program without it, then don't interact

# If you're a reviewing a PR:
* **Test the changes** that you're reviewing
* **Stay civil** to other people!
